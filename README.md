#Adaptive Diversity Based  Ensemble-method for binary classification

Folder 1:Paper and refered paper 

Folder 2:Codes-contains the working codes 
	 driver codes - These are the runnable scripts which are used to construct the ensemble classifier using different              			diversity methods.
	 base model selector codes - These codes are used to select the base models from different single train models using 				hierarchical clustering and rmsd method
	 manipulate_dataset - This code is used for feature enginnering on the Repeat Buyers Prediction Dataset.
	 relabeler - This is used for relabeling the train data set
	 meta_model - This is used for constructing and training the meta model
	 Graph Codes - Plots the bar graphs
