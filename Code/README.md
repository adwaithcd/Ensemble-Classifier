There are 4 folders

Folder 1:Base Paper and refered paper 
Folder 2:Codes-contains the working codes
			driver codes - These are the runnable scripts which are used to construct the ensemble classifier using different diversity 						methods.
			base model selector codes - These codes are used to select the base models from different single train models using 							hierarchical clustering and rmsd method
			manipulate_dataset - This code is used for feature enginnering on the Repeat Buyers Prediction Dataset.
			relabeler - This is used for relabeling the train data set
			meta_model - This is used for constructing and training the meta model
			Graph Codes - Plots the bar graphs
